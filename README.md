Welcome to my Portfolio Project repository! This project serves as a showcase of my skills and work in software development. The goal is to create a personal portfolio website that demonstrates my expertise, projects, and achievements. This README provides an overview of the project and instructions on how to set it up.

## Description

The **My Portfolio Project** is a web application that showcases my professional journey, skills, and achievements in the field of software development. It features sections highlighting my projects, skills, blog posts, and more. The project is built using the Vert.x framework, allowing for scalable and efficient microservice architecture. It utilizes various technologies, such as Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Microservices Architecture

The portfolio is designed using a microservices architecture, enabling the project to be modular, maintainable, and easily scalable. Each section of the portfolio, such as projects, skills, and blog posts, is developed as a separate microservice, promoting separation of concerns and independent development and deployment.

## Getting Started

To set up the project locally and explore my portfolio:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Java and Maven installed.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Run `mvn clean package` to build the project.
5. Run `java -jar target/my-portfolio-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` to start the application.
6. Open a web browser and visit `http://localhost:8080` to view the portfolio.

## Features

- Projects: Showcase of my software development projects with descriptions and links.
- Skills: Highlighting my technical skills and expertise.
- Blog: A collection of blog posts sharing insights and experiences.
- Contact: Contact information and links to social media profiles.
